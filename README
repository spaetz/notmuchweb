notmuch-web
===========

requirements jinja2, python (>=2.6), python-webpy
Python 2.6 because of simplejson, otherwise 2.4 minimum(?)

Usage
-----
1) configure notmuch to work on your box.
   To get support for notmuch tags you need to apply this patch to notmuch
   http://github.com/spaetz/notmuch-all-feature/commit/dcfcdc6e2aac39a2cef5063fc272e1abc95c057b
   In fact, the python json parser seems to crash on notmuch json output 
   without somtimes.
2) cd notmuchweb; python notmuchweb.py
3) Open browser at http://localhost:8080

Currently 3 API calls are implemented. XXX can be any notmuch search-term:

/id:messageidhere (shows a specific message with body)
/show/XXX         (show only matching messages as a list)
/search/XXX       (show matching messages including their threads)

Configuration
-------------
web.py can be configured as wsgi application, see the web.py documentation for more.


Templates
---------
The templates are standard jinja2 templates. Documentation for that is here: 
http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/documentation/

Each template gets a "msgs" object which is a list of (depth,
Message()) tuples. Please refer to the (non yet existing)
documentation of the Message() class for attributes and methods.
